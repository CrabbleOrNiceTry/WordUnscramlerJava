# WordUnscramblerJava

Hey, so basically, you run this program, type in a scrambled set of letters and then get the longest possible word that can be made out 
of that set of letters. You probably will get a really funky word, because the dictionary I downloaded has a but load of words in there 95% of I don't recongnize, like ataractic. Look it up its a real word. BTW if you are trying to find where I got the dictionary here 
is the github link.

For example: if you were to enter in a 4 letter set of scrambled letters like "dgoo" the longest word that can be returned is a 4 letter word.

If you find anything incorrect with this program, or that it does not run please let me know.
